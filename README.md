# BST-222-Survival-Analysis

This course is an introduction to methods for the analysis of time-toevent data such as occur in medical and epidemiological research, engineering reliability studies, and actuarial calculations, with the main emphasis on the first of these three fields of application. Topics include censoring and truncation of data, life tables, nonparametric methods, parametric methods, accelerated failure time models, proportional hazards models, and likelihood and partial likelihood. We will look at the theoretical underpinnings of the models, but the main emphasis will be on model formulation, computation, and interpretation of results. For COVID procedures see Lecture 1 posted on the web site.
